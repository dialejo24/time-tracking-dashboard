## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript

### What I learned

I put in practice some of the knowledge i had acquired previously, though i wasn't able to solve a problem like i meant to do.
the thing that i reinforced by solving this challenges was the use of the background-image, background-size and background-position

Some meaningful code snipets:

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  background-image: url("../images/icon-play.svg");
  background-position: right 19px top -5px;
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-size: 4.2em;
}
```

### Continued development

I want to continue strengthening my CSS and JS Skills. I want to focus my attention on how to handle
JSON properly. I also want to improve my understanding of semantic HTML and accesability.
